  <p> My office is in South College, room 302. South College has a bit of a reputation as a maze. The easiest way to get to my office is the following.</li>

  <ol>

    <li> <p> Find South College (It's the old brick building right next to the Du Bois Library).</p></li>

    <li> <p> Enter the building through entrance D (marked on the map below). It's on the side that does not face the library.</p></li>

    <li> <p> Climb the stairs to the top. Go through the door (it should be unlocked).</p></li>

    <li> <p> Go left. You will walk through a corridor to a big open room with a lot of chairs. My office is in room 302, which will be straight ahead (the yellow dot on the map).</p></li>

  </ol>

      </tr>
    </table>
  </center>

<div class="text">

  <p> If for some reason the door is at the top of the stairs is locked, go back down and exit the building (I'm sorry if it's winter!). </p>
    <ol>
      <li> <p>Enter through door A (facing the library). </p></li>
      <li> <p>Go up the stairs, turn right, and make your way through the buidling. You'll pass some offices. Go through the door past them, up the stairs to your right.</p></li> 
      <li> <p>Go down the the long corridor, passing more offices. This will eventually lead to the room with all the chairs, where my office is.</p></li>

    </ol>


<p> Basically, just keep going up stairs to the opposite end of the building. If you get lost, ask somebody for help. The people in the office should be able to direct you if nobody else is around.</p>
