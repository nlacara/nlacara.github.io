        <h1><a name="bio">Bio<a></h1>
        
            I grew up in <a class="ext" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell,_California">Campbell, California</a>, a suburb of San José in the Silicon Valley. I attended <a class="ext" href="https://www.mitty.com/">Archbishop Mitty High School</a> in San José, where I developed interests in literature, philosophy, and the Spanish language. In 2004, I went to <a class="ext" href="https://linguistics.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz</a> and started taking classes in linguistics after a lucky encounter with someone from the department during summer orientation. I was also fortunate enough to study abroad at the <a class="ext" href="https://www.york.ac.uk/language/">University of York</a>, where I took courses in phonetics and language variation. Upon my return to Santa Cruz, however, I was quickly drawn to syntax, the area in which I now work. I completed my BA with department honors in 2008, and stayed at Santa Cruz to pursue a masters degree. After finishing this in 2010, I moved to Northampton, MA, to pursue my PhD at <a class="ext" href="http://www.umass.edu/linguistics/">UMass Amherst</a>. I completed the PhD in 2016 and stayed at UMass for a year teaching. I'm currently a visiting assistant professor at the <a class="ext" href="http://linguistics.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a>.
