              <div class="abs" id="NPE" style="display:none;">
                The distribution of noun phrase ellipsis (NPE) in English appears to be limited by the distribution of the N<sup>0</sup> pro-form <i>one</i>, but understanding how these two phenomena interact remains a challenge. I argue that <i>one</i> is derivationally unrelated to NPE and that they are not complementary reflexes of the same phenomenon. I propose instead that they compete to realize anaphoric relations between sub-DP constituents. I sketch how this might work, by appealing to interface conditions on <i>one</i> and NPE, arguing that they stand in categorically different relations to F-marked material in their domains. I then look at some of the empirical problems for this analysis.

                Predicate clefts come in two forms, one in which a verbal phrase is topicalized (typically <i>v</i>P), and another in which only a verb is topicalized. I begin this paper by defending the view that, at least in some languages, the topicalized verb is a bare head (typically a <i>v</i><sup>0</sup>). I then extend <a href="#LSA2016">my 2016 analysis of predicate clefts</a> to cases where only <i>v</i><sup>0</sup> (rather than a <i>v</i>P) is topicalized. These additional data show that head movement must feed A&prime;-movement, providing evidence that head movement cannot be a purely PF phenomenon and ruling out certain approaches to head movement that apply after Spell Out.

                Despite displaying both verb movement and verb phrase ellipsis, Scandinavian languages do not display verb-stranding verb phrase ellipsis, as predicted by Goldberg (2005). Sailor's (to appear) analysis of this fact yields the appealing idea that the difference between languages with and without verb-stranding verb phrase ellipsis has to do with which heads attract the verb. When combined with Aelbrecht's (2010) theory of derivational freezing, the difference between Scandinavian and other verb-movement languages falls out. But when we turn to verb phrase topicalization, a similar dichotomy appears: Languages with verb movement strand verbs, but Scandinavian does not. In light of this fact, this paper investigates what is necessary to preserve Sailor's intuition that verb-stranding behavior is related to the head that attracts the verb.

              In this reply, I reevaluate <a class="ext" target="_blank" href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/4179310">Hankamer and Mikkelsen's (2005, et seq.)</a> claim that the definite suffix in Danish DPs appears when the definite determiner is adjacent to a minimal N. The central observation I make is that this analysis does not allow any nominal morphological structure to be built in the syntax, which is incompatible with the standard goals of Distributed Morphology. The problem is with the proposal that D<sub>[DEF]</sub> is realized as a suffix when it takes a minimal N as its sister: Mainstream DM proposes that there is no such thing as a minimal N. I propose instead that D<sub>[DEF]</sub> is realized as a suffix when it immediately c-commands the Num head. Adjunction of adjectives and relative clauses to Num interrupts this relation, resulting in D<sub>[DEF]</sub> being realized as the article.

                This paper investigates the interaction of head movement and ellipsis licensing. I show that the apparent movement of ellipsis-licensing heads does not extend the domain of ellipsis at LF or PF, an issue that has largely gone unobserved and remains to be addressed in current theories of ellipsis licensing. I argue that adopting a non-movement analysis of head movement avoids the problem on the traditional view that ellipsis is essentially an interface phenomenon triggered by licensing heads. I then discuss what happens if we assume that ellipsis occurs during the narrow-syntactic derivation and whether it can provide a better account of the facts introduced earlier. I argue that effects similar to those discussed before may still arise under this view and that blocking them requires stipulating an order of operations imposed by ellipsis licensing heads.

                It has proven difficult to understand what drives apparent <i>wh</i>-movement in languages with multiple sluicing that lack multiple <i>wh</i>-movement. Many authors, including <a class="ext" href="http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1557883/1/AbelsDayalNELS%20v2.pdf">Abels and Dayal (2017)</a>, <a class="ext" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1524/9783050074757">Gärtner (2002)</a>, and <a class="ext" href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/movement-in-language-9780199246519?cc=us&lang=en&">Richards 2001</a>, propose that the appearance of multiple <i>wh</i>-remnants in these languages is the result of an interaction of covert <i>wh</i>-chains with ellipsis: Ellipsis of the tail of a covert <i>wh</i>-movement chain forces pronunciation of a higher link in the chain, deriving exceptional <i>wh</i>-movement. Although this makes for an elegant analysis of multiple sluicing, I argue in this short paper that the assumptions underlying the analysis appear to make unwelcome predictions about <i>wh</i>-movement out of verb phrase ellipsis sites. Verb phrase ellipsis should motivate exceptional multiple <i>wh</i>-movement, but it does not appear to do so.

                This paper investigates the use of ellipsis diagnostics to determine whether deletion has occurred in as-parentheticals. As-parentheticals look as though they contain verb phrase ellipsis, but <a class="ext" href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1015892718818">Potts (2002)</a> argues that they do not. A number of diagnostics that have been used to distinguish ellipsis from null pro-forms are discussed in some detail. These diagnostics show that the deletion process in as-parentheticals is distinct from canonical verb phrase ellipsis. Instead, it shares properties with comparative deletion (<a class="ext" href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1015889823361">Kennedy 2002</a>). Thus, I argue that once a broader range of facts is considered, we need to include some manner of deletion in the derivation as-parentheticals.

          Doctoral Dissertation, University of Massachusetts Amherst, 1 September 2016.

              <div class="abs" id="dissertation" style="display:none;">
                My doctoral research focuses on a class of constructions known as <i>as</i>-parentheticals, represented by the bracketed material in the following example:<br>
                <br>
                    - Mary loves John, [as might Sally]. <br>
                <br>
                This construction is significant in several ways: 1) It obligatorily lacks an overt verb phrase, 2) The meaning of the missing verb phrase is inherited from the phrase to which it adjoins, and 3) subjects in as-parentheticals appear after auxiliary verbs rather than before them.<br>
                <br>
                <p class="article_title">tl;dr</p>: I argue that <i>as</i>-parentheticals are syntactically (and semantically) similar to equatives. A&prime;-movement introduces an island violation that verb phrase ellipsis must ameliorate to make the structure pronounceable. This A&prime;-movement is responsible for the strict locality conditions on the antecedent, not ellipsis. The need to focus the subject is in part responsible for the non-canonical placement of subjects.<br>
                <br>
                
                First, I argue that despite previous research on the topic (<a class="ext" href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1015892718818">Potts 2002</a>, <a href="#lacara2015">LaCara 2015</a>), verb phrases go missing in this construction due to verb phrase ellipsis -- the typical operation that deletes verb phrases. Evidence for this comes from other languages, including Dutch and Spanish, where I argue as-parentheticals can only contain clauses where ellipsis is independently possible. The ellipsis explains how as-parentheticals get their meanings, but since ellipsis is normally optional, this raises questions about the obligatory nature of the ellipsis.<br>
                <br>
                I account for why the deletion in as-parentheticals must be obligatory by building on work on comparatives, which also host obligatory ellipsis. Potts (2002) demonstrates that as-parentheticals contain an A-bar dependency similar to comparatives. Following his work, I show that this can be used to account for some unusual locality restrictions in as-parentheticals. This same A-bar dependency, I argue, also explains the obligatory deletion. Under the model of <a class="ext" href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1006362716348">Kennedy and Merchant (2000)</a>, I argue that the deletion ameliorates and island violation introduced by the movement.<br>
                <br>
                The final chapter of my dissertation investigates the unusual subject placement in as-parentheticals. This placement, I argue, is a last-resort phenomenon (see <a class="ext" href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002400">Weir 2014</a>), driven by the obligatory deletion just described. This placement is contrasted with other non-canonical subject placements (like locative inversion), and I offer an account of how PF constraints can drive these phenomena.

                Since Chomsky (2001) suggested that head movement might be a PF operation, there has been debate about the proper place of head movement in the grammar. The interaction of verb movement with verb phrase fronting can shed light on how and when head movement occurs. This paper looks at cases where verb phrase fronting generates two copies of the verb (as in Portuguese or Hebrew), one in the fronted vP and one in an inflectional position, showing how a PF approach to head movement can explain this pattern while addressing some potential problems in other languages.

              In this paper, I investigate the syntax of inverting <i>as</i>-parentheticals, a subclass of parenthetical <i>as</i>-clause that is anaphorically dependent on a previously uttered predicate that, in addition, exhibits properties of certain kinds of discourse inversion identified by <a class="ext" href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/415828">Birner (1994)</a>. I argue that these constructions contain deletion, following recent work on predicate <i>as</i>-parentheticals. I go on to show that some of the unusual syntactic properties in inverting <i>as</i>-parentheticals are shared with other sorts of discourse inversion constructions (as seen in recent work by <a class="ext" href="https://sites.google.com/site/bsamko/">Bern Samko</a>), and that these properties can be explained if we provide the constructions similar derivations.

            <div class="abs" id="IDII" style="display:none;">
              This paper proposes that placement of plural agreement morphology after clitics in Spanish imperatives is the result of the interaction of syntactic word building with PF constraints that motivate unfaithful mappings of the underlying syntactic structure to linear order. I start with the assumption that the syntax is responsible for generating base structures for words. In dialects displaying <i>inflectional displacement</i>, where agreement suffixes appear after or between clitics, I argue that PF constraints on the placement of morphemes place clitics and agreement suffixes in competition for the same position(s) in a word. This competition gives rise to the various displacement patterns observed. In the case of <i>inflectional iteration</i>, where multiple agreement suffixes appear, I propose that the separate agreement suffixes are the result of multiple heads in the clausal spine sharing agreement features via syntactic Agree. Placement of the suffixes is again determined by PF constraints, and I propose an approach here that relies on restrictions on Spanish phonotactics. Though they involve the same morphological material in the same domain, the analyses I pursue suggest that inflectional displacement and iteration are inherently different phenomena, given that the analysis of each phenomenon is fundamentally different. I argue that the approaches in this paper are superior to previous accounts, specifically <a class="ext" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/0024389053710710">Harris and Halle (2005)</a> and <a class="ext" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=o94lcr55kZoC&lpg=PA7&ots=SXuK93ECdk&dq=los%20cl%C3%ADticos%20seguidos%20harris&pg=PA29#v=onepage&q&f=false">Harris 1998</a>, in that the approaches here are more constrained and better fit the attested data.

              A squib on why verb phrase ellipsis cannot happen in clauses that contain locative inversion. The main argument is that subjects are low enough in the structure to be targeted by VPE, but since these subjects must receive focus they cannot be deleted. I also look at cases of VPE that contain embedded sluices and argue that these can be explained if a semantic identity constraint is assumed. Several of the issues raised here are taken up in <a href="#lacara2016">my dissertation</a>.

              Predicate <i>which</i> appositives are a kind of parenthetical relative clause that take as their antecedents syntactic material denoting a predicate. These constructions have most notably been worked on by <a class="ext" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9612.00047/abstract?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+21+May+from+10-12+BST+for+monthly+maintenance">Potts (2002)</a>. My interest in the construction is a number of ellipsis-like properties that they show in spite of the fact that there is (evidently) overt <i>wh</i>-movement in the construction from the position where a VP (or other phrase) has apparently been deleted. My analysis borrows the idea that a VP can be pronominalized, following <a class="doc" class="ext" href="http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~mikkelsen/papers/wecol_paper_final_web.pdf">Houser, et al (2007)</a>, and that this can be used to explain why a <i>wh</i>-pronoun seems to take the place of the missing VP, which appears to be syntactically present and fully specified.

              This project aims to investigate definiteness marking as it occurs in Standard Swedish. The project grew out of work on Danish in Distributed Morphology started by <a class="ext" href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/4179310">Hankamer and Mikkelsen (2005)</a> and builds on observations by several authors about the relation of the definite article and definite suffix with various aspects of the semantics of definite descriptions in Swedish. The above paper appears in <a class="ext" href="http://escholarship.org/uc/lrc_masc">Morphology at Santa Cruz</a> (see below).

              A response to the notion, revived and suggested in works like <a class="ext" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1014290323028">Elbourne 2001</a> and <a class="ext" href="http://ling.auf.net/lingBuzz/000341">Harley 2007</a>, that noun phrase ellipsis is involved in the derivation of anaphoric <i>one</i>. I argue against this idea, using typical ellipsis diagnostics. This paper is currently being revised.

		The culmination of this project is represented by my MA Thesis (defended 6 May 2010, UCSC). In this thesis I demonstrate that classical theories of verb phrase ellipsis cannot account for the ungrammaticality of cases of VPE inside of Abney-style poss-ing DPs when the antecedent is located in another sort of phrase (for example <i>Harvey gesticulated wildly because of Sally's gesticulating wildly</i> vs. <i>*Harvey gesticulated wildly because of Sally's</i>.). Since my thesis, I have been looking at the problem in a Rooth/Heim-type of focus theory of Ellipsis, which will hopefully resolve some of the remaining problems.

               Recent work on head movement proposes it is derived by an operation distinct from phrasal movement, but little attention has been paid to differences between alternative approaches to head movement. I argue predicate clefts provide evidence had movement is not a post-syntactic operation; some portion of the phenomenon happens before Spell Out. Still, I argue head movement is not derived by the process deriving phrasal movement. A predictive theory of predicate clefts requires a non-movement approach to head movement but not a post-syntactic one.

              In previous work I argue that (VP) ellipsis is responsible for deriving predicate gaps in <i>as</i>-parentheticals. In this talk I discuss puzzling data from languages that lack a general VPE operation but allow ellipsis after base modals, so-called modal complement anaphora. Following a suggestion by Luis Vicente in an unpublished manuscript, languages that display MCA rather than VPE should only allow gaps in <i>as</i>-parentheticals where MCA is possible. I show that gaps in <i>as</i>-parentheticals in French, Spanish, and Italian only follow modals, but the distribution of these gaps than one would initially expect. This suggests that MCA is ultimately responsible for deriving these gaps, but that <i>as</i>-parentheticals limit its distribution in previous unobserved ways. This follows work in chapter 2 of <a href="#lacara2016">my dissertation</a>.

	      <br>
	      Since <a class="ext" href="http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Linguistics/TheoreticalDescriptiveLinguistic/?view=usa&ci=9780199243723">Merchant 2001</a>, the standard picture of ellipsis has been that a functional head bearing a feature [E] licenses the deletion of its complement at PF. Certain kinds of inversion structures, like locative inversion, pose a problem for such an approach. The theory as currently understood predicts that VP ellipsis should be possible in sentences containing such structures, but as the title of this poster shows, they are ungrammatical. This poster presents an account of these facts, and investigates solutions that do not contravene Merchant-like theories.

	      <div class="abs" id="whpar2" style="display:none;">
		Predicate <i>which</i> appositives are a kind of parenthetical relative clause that take as their antecedents syntactic material denoting a predicate. These constructions have most notably been worked on by <a class="ext" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9612.00047/abstract?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+21+May+from+10-12+BST+for+monthly+maintenance">Potts (2002)</a>. My interest in the construction is a number of ellipsis-like properties that they show in spite of the fact that there is (evidently) overt <i>wh</i>-movement in the construction from the position where a VP (or other phrase) has apparently been deleted. My analysis borrows the idea that a VP can be pronominalized, following <a class="doc" class="ext" href="http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~mikkelsen/papers/wecol_paper_final_web.pdf">Houser, et al (2007)</a>, and that this can be used to explain why a <i>wh</i>-pronoun seems to take the place of the missing VP, which appears to be syntactically present and fully specified.
