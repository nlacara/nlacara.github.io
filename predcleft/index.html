              This paper is an extension of my 2016 LSA paper. After reviewing theoretical appraoches to predicate clefting, I argue that alternative approaches to head displacement phenomena predict verb doubling in predicate clefts &ndash; both those that topicalize verb phrases and bare verbs. Furthermore, I argue predicate clefts provide evidence that head movement must derivationally feed A'-movement, building on work by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9612.2006.00084.x" class="ext">Landau (2006)</a> and <a href="https://www.lotpublications.nl/Documents/154_fulltext.pdf" class="ext">Vicente (2007)</a>. Since A'-movement is considered to be a narrow syntactic phenomenon, it follows that head movement must also be, ruling out purely post-syntactic approaches to the phenomenon. <br>
              <br>
              The associated CLA poster summarizes one of several arguments in the paper, focusing on the timing of head movement in bare verb predicate clefts.

	    <li><b>Verb Phrase Movement as a Window Into Head Movement</b> (2016) &mdash; <a class="ext" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3765/plsa.v1i0.3714">Paper</a> &bull;  <a class="doc" href="../papers/lacara-LSA2016proc.pdf">Manuscript</a> <br> <i>Proceedings of the Linguistic Society of America</i>, 1, 17:1&ndash;14 <br>

              Since Chomsky (2001) suggested that head movement might be a PF operation, there has been debate about the proper place of head movement in the grammar. The interaction of verb movement with verb phrase fronting can shed light on how and when head movement occurs. This paper looks at cases where verb phrase fronting generates two copies of the verb (as in Portuguese or Hebrew), one in the fronted vP and one in an inflectional position, showing how a PF approach to head movement can explain this pattern while addressing some potential problems in other languages.
